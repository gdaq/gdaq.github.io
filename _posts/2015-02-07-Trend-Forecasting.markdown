This week, **Cisco** [released](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/white_paper_c11-520862.html#Trend_7_VoWiFi_Wildcard) its annual Visual Networking Index (**VNI**) forecast. On it,  Cisco made some intimidating growth projections of the global data traffic growth. Let's see...

According to Cisco, by **2019**:

- There will be **5.2 billion** global mobile users, up from 4.3 billion in 2014
- There will be **11.5 billion** mobile-ready devices and connections, more than 4 billion more than there were in 2014
- The average mobile connection speed will increase 2.4-fold, from 1.7 Mbps in 2014 to **4.0 Mbps** by 2019
- Global mobile IP traffic will reach an annual run rate of **292 exabytes**, up from 30 exabytes in 2014
- The overall mobile data traffic is expected to grow to **24.3 exabytes** per month by 2019, nearly a tenfold increase over 2014.

However among these projections, VNI gave us hints of some interesting **new trends** that could soon change the way mobile networks are today.

**VoWiFi** is a trendy technology that has been getting the lights since the latest iPhone came out. But it is not just a new phone feature, it is actually a technology that has been around for a while, but the earlier solutions had several limitations that affected the adoption and ultimately the end-user experience. 

However nowadays, and thanks to several enhancements that have been made, VoWiFi is a **stable**, **reliable** and **secure** solution. Because of it, there are already several MNOs that have recently launched or announced a launch of VoWiFi service. 

In fact, according to the VNI, VoWiFi will **surpass VoLTE** in terms of minutes of use by 2018. By 2019, VoWi-Fi will have **53 %** of mobile IP voice, up from less than a tenth of a percent in 2014. Which is actually funny, since the deployments of VoIP, or VoLTE started long time ago.

>This data not only shows the big impact VoWiFi will have in the future, but also the how **WiFi** networks are becoming a crucial element of mobile cellular networks. By deploying a WiFi network, MNOs will not only be able to **offload** data traffic,  but also, thanks to VoWiFi, operators will be able to deliver a cost-effective, scalable, and high quality **indoor** coverage, where cellular coverage is poor. 

So all those operators who have been opposed to WiFi in the past, should better catch up!
