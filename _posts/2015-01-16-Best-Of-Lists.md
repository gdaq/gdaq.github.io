Today the Academy Award nominations were [announced](http://oscar.go.com/nominees "Oscar Nominations"). After going through the list of nominees I knew I had a lot of catching up to do [^fn1]. Because that's what the lists are for, right?

>There are *best of* lists for everything.

No matter how specific or broad a topic is, there will be a *best of list* of it. There are millions of websites and blogs posting *best of* lists. I do the same in my music blog. Every december µ sique posts a list with the best records of the year. [µ sique](http://mu-sique.com), my music blog, is one of those.

Every year I put a lot of time creating something special. A one-of-a-kind list. I think not only about the records that make the list itself, but also about the design behind the list.

I am very lucky to have a designer (and a very good one) as a girlfriend. We spend many weeks deciding what's the best design for the list. We would start with a main  design theme, and then develop different cases and variations considering the records' artworks.

> With many *best of* lists around, the design of my list becomes very important; it's what makes it unique.

So if you haven't checked it out, [now](http://mu-sique.com/post/105878182251/mejoresdiscos2014) it's a perfect time to catch up with last year's best music.

[^fn1]: I've only watched a couple movies from the 'Best Picture' category. I think Wes Anderson's "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is fantastic, and Iñarritu's "Birdman" has a lot of merit for being risky.
