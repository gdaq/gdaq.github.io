This week Ericsson, in collaboration with EY, [explained](http://www.ericsson.com/ourportfolio/telecom-operators/growth-codes?nav=marketcategory002) why some operators are more successful than others, and what are the strategies adopted by these so-called Frontrunners in order to achieve those great results:

>"Our key finding was that there are six common traits that are shared by frontrunners â€“ we call these Growth Codes. [...]
>They share a common focus on network performance and customer experience, but their differentiation, innovation and technology approaches vary by strategy.

Something that I found very interesting is that according to the study, the frontrunners are not necessarly the market leaders. 

The fact of being a small/medium-size operator does not mean your are doomed, on the contrary it allows you to be more disruptive, and become a frontrunner by following the "Codes".
